# OverTheWire Bandit 
## This was created for learning linux in an interactive way

Bandit is an online platform aimed for absolute beginners for learning linux. They use ssh to connect to each level of the challenge and to advance to next level requires the user to find the password using different linux commands. 

The best resource to learn about each tool is the man command which provides the manual of a command. for example "man ls" provides the manual of ls command.

Each level of bandit is connected by the command 
```
banditx@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
```
where x stands for the level number (currently 0-34)

The first level can be accessed by the password bandit0
